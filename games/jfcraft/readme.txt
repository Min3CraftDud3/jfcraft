JFCraft/0.18
============

Yet another implementation of the MineCraft game.
Written in Java.
Includes 0% Minecraft source or resources.
Uses the Faithful Texture pack.
Is not compatible with the official game in anyway.

Some parts of the game are complete but much is still left to do.
See todo.txt for a full list.

I've done other clones of MC using web based interfaces but they all failed.
This time I wrote it in Java like the original and making much better progress.
I'm using my JavaForce library to use OpenGL instead of using LWJGL.

The controls are like the original.  Plus a few extras for testing:
 c = toggle flying mode
 r/f = fly up/down (no clipping)

The server includes a VoIP comm system similar to TeamSpeak.
Hold in the right CTRL key to talk (PTT).

This is alpha software so please do not open bug requests.

Thanks.
